Welcome to CodeNow, a website inspired by CodeClause. In my pursuit, I've not only replicated CodeClause's design but have infused my own creative elements. I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to complete this task. 

I decided to go with the same colour palette as that of CodeClause as the palette creates a striking contrast. I’ve changed the font of the original site, and added Montserrat from Google Font. For the icons, I have used Font Awesome and included the CDN link in the HTML. The home page consists of a Navigation bar, a hero image, some statistics related to the website, features, testimonials, frequently asked question section and a footer. The FAQ section is an accordion which is done through plain Javascript. The content (including statistics) is from CodeClause and I’d like to give the credits to them. For the testimonials, I decided to go with anonymous pictures. The home page ensures responsiveness and has slight adjustments as the widths vary. Eg, for smaller screens, the navigation menu is replaced by a menu-bar icon which when clicked opens displays the menu. The user can close it by clicking the close icon. This was achieved through plain Javascript too. For some extra fanciness, I decided to add hovering effects to some of the elements.

The most challenging part of the entire website was the slanted section and its responsiveness. After brainstorming and playing around with CSS, I was able to achieve the layout.
